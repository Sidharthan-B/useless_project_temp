### Project Description
Spoilerringg is the alarm clock you didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd hate to love! When the alarm goes off, it hits you with a spoiler question that you have to answer correctly to turn it off. Will you face the spoilers or endure the alarm?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Waking up is too easy these days. What if you had to sacrifice your favorite show or movie‚Äôs plot twists to get out of bed?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Spoilerringg, the only alarm that spoils your favorite media if you don‚Äôt answer a question! Wake up, answer a spoiler question, and you‚Äôre free‚Äîunless you get it wrong!
